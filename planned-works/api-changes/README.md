# API changes

The UO API has remained relatively unchanged since the project's inception. We are proposing a number of changes to address some deficiencies, including
  * sensors which have no fixed location and may move on a regular basis, such as vehicles
  * popular demand for real-time streaming of data as it enters our system
  
The documents in here detail some of the proposals, and we'll add more detail as our plans develop.

Updated API specification will initially be trialled for our data from the Urban Sciences Building, as part of 'Building as a Lab'.
